## Color Contrast
A contrast ratio is the difference in brightness between two colors expressed as a ratio. White text on a white background would have lowest ratio (1:1), while black text on a white background would have the highest (21:1). Contrast ratios refer to both normal text as well as images of text.

Normal text is defined as text with a font size thatâ€™s less than 18 points/24px (or less than 14 points/18.66px for bold text), and large text is defined as text with a font size that is at least 18 points/24px (or at least 14 points/18.66px for bold text).

* Level AA (minimum) requires a contrast ratio of at least 4.5:1 for normal text and 3:1 for large text.
* Level AAA (enhanced) requires a contrast ratio of at least 7:1 for normal text and 4.5:1 for large text.
