# WCAG
## The Web Content Accessibility Guidelines
## 4 Principles

1. **Perceivable**: Users must be able to perceive the information or user interfaces being presented. For example, light text on a light background could be difficult for some users with a visual impairment to perceive.
2. **Operable**: Users must be able to operate any user interfaces or navigation, and interfaces cannot require an interaction which the user cannot perform. A navigation bar with drop-down menus that only expand when a mouse cursor hovers over them, for example, would not be operable by keyboard users giving those menu items focus.
3. **Understandable**: Users must be able to understand any information or user interface that is presented to them. For example, if a user tried submitting a form and received an error such as “Error 113: Bad data”, they wouldn’t be able to understand what the error actually means or how to fix whatever caused the error.
4. **Robust**: Content must be accessible by current assistive technologies and other user agents, and must remain accessible as those technologies advance.

## 3 Levels of Conformance
* **Level A**, or essential support, is the minimum level of conformance for the WCAG.
* **Level AA**, or ideal support, is the level many organizations strive for. Meeting this level also requires meeting Level A.
* **Level AAA**, or specialized support, isn’t recommended for entire sites to meet in full, as some content may make it impossible to meet this conformance level. Meeting this level would require also meeting both Level A and Level AA.
