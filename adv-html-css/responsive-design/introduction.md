# Introduction to Responsive Design
## What screen sizes should we support
* Lowest resolution: 320px
* Highest resolution: 2560px

## Viewport meta tag
It simply sets the initial width of the webpage to the size of the actual screen youâ€™re viewing it on, and telling it not to zoom in or out.
```html
<meta name="viewport" content="width=device-width, initial-scale=1">
```
## Avoid fixed width and height
Obviously the context will determine what works in a given situation, but an easy fix in many cases is replacing width or height with max-width or min-height (min-width and max-height are also valid and may be useful depending on the context).

### Use flex and grid!

## Responsive Images
If an image is given a flexible width, and the height is set to auto, then it should retain its aspect ratio correctly.

## Media queries
```css
body {
  margin: 24px;
}

@media (max-width: 600px) {
  body {
    margin: 8px;
  }
}
```
